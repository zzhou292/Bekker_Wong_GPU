# Bekker_Wong_GPU

Jason Zhou ME 759 Final Project

This is an initial attempt to bring Bekker-Wong Terrain model into GPU

This implementation targets to achieve:
1. An initial GPU implementation of a 3-dimesional flat B-W terrain
2. A analytical wheel-terrain interaction (limited to 1 pair)
3. Visualization output of both the terrain and wheel object

The limitation is stated as below:

1. The wheel shape is limited to a perfect cylinder
2. B-W terrain is limited and can only be initialized as a flat terrain
